                               FASTTEXT + T5 SECURITY SYSTEM
This work is a basic lightweight prortotype designed to take care of user privacy in interactions with Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT and Gemini.This system basically integrates:
                                            FastText:For query classification in resource-constrained environments
                                            T5 Small:Context based query classification,rephrasing and privacy aware prompt generation
It is very important to note that this work is a basic level,dummy implementation and does not satisfy full deployment such as real time integration,,broader dataset or realtime scalability.It serves as a foundational 
prototype only.


                              FEATURES
                              Lightweight FastText based sensitivity classifier
                              T5 model for semantic understanding
                              Provides a stepping stone for future real time,large scale deployments


                              EXPECTED FLOW
                              FastText classifier detects query sensitivity
                              T5 Small rephrases query to preseve privacy
                              Privacy based prompt is generated for downstream processing
